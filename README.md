# Machine-Learning-Classification
Project on estimating obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.

The dataset contains 17 attributes, with each record labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level). The NObesity variable allows classifying the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II, and Obesity Type III. 

77% of the data was generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, while 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.
